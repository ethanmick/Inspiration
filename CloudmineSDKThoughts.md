# What I liked

Adding file from data is excellent <3

# What I wanted to see
File issues. I can't store the meta data with the files, so I need to have another object to use with the file. Annoying.

Class Documentation on all the objects in the SDK. Found it (better link?)

Users should/can/maybe store username/password, and not just the token?



Caching & Syncing would be hard... but amazing. (Core data integration?)

Not sure what the extra options do. Maybe solves my problems like getting batches?

Not being able to save to global level and user level with the same object doesn't make a ton of sense, at the very least it should just make a new object in the background.

At one point, all of my data was deleted? Not sure how.
