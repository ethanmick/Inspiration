# What I liked

Adding file from data is excellent <3

# What I wanted to see
File issues. I can't store the meta data with the files, so I need to have another object to use with the file. Annoying.

Class Documentation on all the objects in the SDK.

Users should/can/maybe store username/password, and not just the token?



Caching & Syncing would be hard... but amazing.

Not sure what the extra options do. Maybe solves my problems like getting batches?
